# Real-Time LBPH Expression Recognition
This was my Senior Research Project on Real-Time LBPH Expression Recognition (2018). It used the OpenCV package and Python to train a model that detected positive or negative expressions on a person's face. These files were stored in YAML format. The prototype simply shows the recognition, but the end goal was to design a system that aggregated data from many different subjects and provided useful statistics.

I have not provided the "archieexpressions.yml" file that contains data on my own facial expressions...but I did include the cascade file I used to detect general faces.
