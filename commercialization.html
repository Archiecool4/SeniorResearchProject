My next step is to commercialize this project. This was my first experience designing and implementing a piece of software. Hopefully, I can be compensated for it. I believe this can be very useful to senior homes who need to keep track of a huge amount of patients as computers can process data far faster than humans. OpenCV is listed under the MIT license so it is free for commercial use with the exception of SURF, SIFT, and the mcs_** xml cascades, none of which I am using.
</p>
<p>
In order to ready the product for a commercial environment, I need to first refine accuracy (by perhaps implementing a more complicated recognition algorithm), and finalize the GUI, or user interface. Additionally, I would like to set up SMS alerts to warn staff of distressed patients. With these two pieces, the software will be capable of handling a senior home environment. Of course, there will have to be a testing phase.

In addition to software, I will have to decide what hardware is necessary for the project to run. I envision relatively high quality webcams (to capture high resolution images) placed throughout designated points in the facility. This is so to capture patients at multiple locations and times throughout the day to gain more accurate data. In addition to these cameras, there needs to be a central unit that controls the system. This could most likely be done with a consumer computer (or perhaps tablet in the future). Additionally, a mobile app would be very useful. Another idea is to make it a web-based application that can be logged on from any PC or mobile device. For this to work, I would need to run a server that could perform the calculations and store the data. This would be decided in the development phase.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I think this project is ripe for commercialization, and it can reasonably enter the testing phase within a year or two, if not sooner.
