My senior research project is intended to study facial expressions through artificial neural networks. Our expressions are oftentimes indicators of the emotions we are feeling. To this end, the ability for a system to automatically determine a person&#8217;s emotional state. Particularly, this has applications in senior care &#8211; where constant monitoring of the patient&#8217;s well-being is necessary.
</p>
<p>
By creating a macro that draws images from video data (through computer vision), faces can be fed into a neural network trained from a database of various facial expressions. Via optimization (perhaps through neuroevolution), a real-time emotion recognition system is hoped to be developed.

What general emotions/facial expressions are you focusing on?</br>

I'm mostly focusing on negative expressions since in senior homes, happy emotions are hopefully not a cause for concern.</br>

Are you designing the neural network yourself or are you using a predesigned one that is trained for your dataset? Do you have a dataset of images that is packaged, for example the Bosphorus database, or are using an assortment of randomly gathered images, tagging them yourself? Good luck!</br>

Thanks! So I'm using Google's TensorFlow which allows you to construct neural networks based off pre-made designs. Essentially, I can build a custom network with very little code using the library. I have an interesting idea too, which is neuroevolution. Basically you create a generation of neural networks and "breed" them to create the most accurate, or fit, one (like natural selection). I can do this with TensorFlow as well. This way I can just have a genetic algorithm find the best neural network of a certain type for me.
With regards to the images I'm either going to use a pre-made database or construct them myself (this probably doesn't sound helpful but it'll make sense if you read my next post).</br>
