<p>
My next step is to commercialize this project. This was my first experience designing and implementing a piece of software. Hopefully, I can be compensated for it. I believe this can be very useful to senior homes who need to keep track of a huge amount of patients as computers can process data far faster...

I talked with Mr. Kotalik this weekend to discuss the graphical user interface, or GUI, I'll be using for people to interact with my program. He first showed me many examples of online web applications to demonstrate how companies design their apps to be easy-to-use. In essence, the lesson was to place the part of...

<p>
When Mr. Kotalik and I were discussing possible questionnaires, we decided we could do two things. The first was to research works on psychology that specialize in assessing emotional states and deduce a questionnaire from that. I have been reading excerpts from Emotion Measurement by Herbert L. Meiselman. Chapter 13 deals with the emotion research in...

Hello everyone. It's been a long while, and that's because I was busy with getting this prototype working. After much trial and error, I finally got something that worked...sort of. It's still a prototype which means its accuracy is not ideal. For example, it has a bit of trouble recognizing the happy expression - often...

These past two weeks have been quite busy for me but it hasn't been without its fruits. I had been attempting to program an eigenface module myself, however I was readily stopped for many reasons, most notably of which was processing time. The larger the images got, the longer it took for the computer to...

<time datetime=2018-03-10" pubdate>March 10, 2018 1:52 pm</time>
<p>
To begin this experiment, I downloaded an open-source Python implementation of the eigenface algorithm. I intend to program it myself later on, however I thought it would be ideal to see how a working implementation functions. The implementation I downloaded was from Aleksandar Gyorev under the MIT license. It came packaged with the famous AT&amp;T...

In this post, I attempt to explain the premise of eigenfaces. In essence, it is a dimensionality-reduction technique. It's not the most elegant solution to the problem of face recognition, but its crudeness allows for a relatively simple and fast implementation. If you'd like to know more, I highly suggest Matthew Turk and Alex Pentland's...

Note: This post is going to be a bit different than the others. I am simply going over concepts used in my project for those that are interested in artificial intelligence (specifically machine learning) and how it works. This is not necessary to understand the gist of what I'm trying to do, so if you're afraid...

Yesterday, I met with Mr Kotalik, my SRP mentor. We discussed the possible routes we could approach the problem and decided to employ the Agile methodology of software development, where one first creates user stories before writing any code. Here is our user story: A patient in a nursing home wakes up and after getting...

My senior research project is intended to study facial expressions through artificial neural networks. Our expressions are oftentimes indicators of the emotions we are feeling. To this end, the ability for a system to automatically determine a person's emotional state. Particularly, this has applications in senior care - where constant monitoring of the patient's well-being...
