When Mr. Kotalik and I were discussing possible questionnaires, we decided we could do two things. The first was to research works on psychology that specialize in assessing emotional states and deduce a questionnaire from that. I have been reading excerpts from <em>Emotion Measurement</em> by Herbert L. Meiselman. Chapter 13 deals with the emotion research in the field of consumerism. This chapter states that emotional responses can be elicited via &#8220;emotion words.&#8221; The section which I read did not specify any emotion words, but I assume, due to the large possible variety, they refer to <em>any</em> words with a strong emotional, situational meaning, e.g. &#8220;Tell me how this six-word story makes you feel: &#8216;For sale: baby shoes, never worn.'&#8221; In the application discussed in the book, this concept refers to surveys and questionnaires given to consumers to judge what emotions a product makes them feel. I believe this can be applied to my project by simply using this research to use emotion words to trigger a response. Not only does the book discuss emotion words, but also the length of a list of emotion words and its effect on a response. The study conducted found that emotional intensity was higher when the list of emotion words was shorter (around 10). Additionally, the study discusses the order of emotion words, however this is found to not have much an effect (except when the words are alphabetized, it appears to facilitate the consumer&#8217;s understanding of the questionnaire). This leads me to the conclusion that a short, yet intense questionnaire should be the best approach should we choose this route.
</p>

Another route, which perhaps would be more effective, would be the usage of films. By depicting intense emotional moments, it is likely receptive individuals would express emotions far more readily than a set of verbal questions. However, this method has its issues, for example, if the patient is not paying attention to the film. Unlike a questionnaire which requires active participation, a video can be tuned out.
</p>
<p>
As a result, I believe the best course of action is a set of questions related to the patient&#8217;s personal life. Perhaps combining emotion words with inquiries into the patient&#8217;s personal life would be effective. For example,
</p>
<p>
<em>Interviewer (I): When you were a kid, did you have a best friend?</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Patient (P): Yes, his name was Alex.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>I: Tell me about a time when you two had a <strong>silly</strong>, <strong>ridiculous </strong>adventure or experience that <strong>completely</strong> backfired. </em>
</p>
<p>
The purpose of such an inquiry is to cause the patient to reminisce on what is hopefully a positive memory. As they remember it, they will hopefully feel those emotions again. Additionally, since it is likely the patient has not thought about such an experience in quite a while, the effect will be ever more potent. I will continue to study more research on the psychology of how words can affect a person&#8217;s demeanor positively/negatively and compose a questionnaire I believe is sufficient to elicit emotional experiences from most people. Additionally, I will continue a search for past questionnaires that had possibly the same or a similar goal to my questionnaire. The amount of research done on this topic is extensive, thus I&#8217;m sure the research has been conducted somewhere.

For use in a specific setting, like a senior assisted living home, would it be best/possible to take samples from the individual patients at the beginning of their stay? I'm wondering if a recorded intake interview, with the types of questions you posed, would help the computer be more accurate.</br>

That's precisely what I'm going for! I envisage an interview being recorded when the patient is processed. The questionnaire will be administered and the patient's responses will be recorded via camera.</br>
